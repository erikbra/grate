# Contributing

I'm very happy that you are reading this page! Grate needs all the contributors it can get!
I'll try to jot down a few notes on how to get started developing grate.

## Get .NET 9 (or later)

Grate is built with .NET 6/7/8/9 (and probably soon .NET 10). You can get it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and start building right away.

## Get (buy, borrow, rent, or whatever) a computer with an operating system on it

.NET 8+ runs on Windows, macOS or Linux. You choose what you like to use for development.

## Get Docker

Grate uses docker extensively for testing against different databases, so you need to get it from e.g. 
[The docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), or you can probably use a package manager on your platform to 
install it.

## Clone the grate repo

```
git clone https://github.com/erikbra/grate.git
```

## Run the tests, to make sure you are properly up and running

```
> cd grate
> dotnet test --framework net9.0
```

## Build a self-contained executable (if you want)

Grate is set up to build in the whole .NET framework in the executable when built in release mode, so the executable is a bit bigger than you 
might expect. But it's totally independent of .NET being installed on the runtime environment at all, and not of the versions actually installed either.
You can build a self-contained executable just using `dotnet build` (example from my mac below)

```
> cd grate/grate
> dotnet publish  -c release -r osx-x64 -o /tmp/grate
```

Find the fully independent executable, and the noticable size:
```
> ls -lh /tmp/grate 
total 59808
-rwxr-xr-x  1 erik  staff    29M Sep 14 23:22 grate
```

Verify that the executable is working:
```
> /tmp/grate/grate 
Option '--connectionstring' is required.

## Open your favourite editor or IDE, and start hacking

I really like [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), but it does cost money. Free alternatives are e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
(free, and cross platform), or [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Use what you love, and start hacking :)
