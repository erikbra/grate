# grate
SQL scripts migration runner 

[![Build](https://github.com/erikbra/grate/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/erikbra/grate/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Goal

The goal of grate is to be (at least almost) feature-complete with RoundhousE, which is an amazing tool. It is initiated by the main
maintainer of RoundhousE for the last three years, please see this issue in the RoundhousE repo for details: https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/438.

## Why the name grate?

grate is short for migrate. And it's also pronounced the same way as _great_, so, there you go. 

## Status

grate is catching up on RoundhousE features, there are a couple of features missing, they are documented in unit tests. But I've successfully replaced 
RoundhousE with grate in a 5-year-in-development folder of SQL scripts, without any issues.
