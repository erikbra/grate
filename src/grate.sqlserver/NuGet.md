# grate

grate is a SQL scripts migration runner, using plain, old SQL for migrations. No meta-language, no code, no config,
no EF migrations. It gives you full flexibility, and full control of your migrations, and lets you use
all the fancy features of you particular database system. You are not constrained to any lowest common
feature set of all supported databases.

## grate.sqlserver

This is the SQL Server provider for grate. It is used to deploy SQL scripts
programmatically to a SQL Server database. For command line usage, please see the
[grate (dotnet tool)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/grate/) package.

## Minimal code example
The only required argument to pass to grate is a **connection string** to tell it where to find your database. 
It will deploy to that database, looking for sql scripts in the current directory.


```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Run_migration_agains_target_db()
{
    var serviceCollection = new ServiceCollection();
    serviceCollection.AddLogging();
    serviceCollection.AddGrate(builder =>
    {
        builder
            .WithSqlFilesDirectory("/db")
            .WithConnectionString("sqlserver connection string here")
    })
    .UseSqlServer(); // Important!, you need to specify the database type to use.
    var serviceProvider = serviceCollection.BuildServiceProvider();
    var grateMigrator = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IGrateMigrator>();
    await grateMigrator.Migrate();
}
```

## grate supports the following DMBS's

| Database  | NuGet package |

## grate.core
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/grate.core.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/grate.core/)

This is the core package, which does nothing by itself. It is mostly useful for writing extensions to grate,
or for writing your own database provider. Please feel free to create your own database provider, and submit it a pull request,
if you need support for a database that is not supported yet.
